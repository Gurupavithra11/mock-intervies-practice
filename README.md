The **AI-powered Mock Interview Website** helps job seekers practice real interview questions in a **simulated environment**. By providing **company-specific questions** (e.g., Genpact and Infosys), it ensures targeted preparation. The **AI voice feature** enhances realism, making the experience closer to an actual interview.  

One major benefit is the **automated questioning system**, which keeps the session interactive, even if the candidate doesnâ€™t respond. This helps in **time management and confidence building**. Additionally, the ability to **record and review answers** allows candidates to improve their **communication skills and clarity** over time.  

Since the platform is **web-based**, users can access it **from any device with a link**, making it a **convenient and scalable solution**. Whether for freshers or professionals, this project enhances **interview readiness** and helps users **identify areas for improvement** before attending real job interviews. ðŸš€
